Delete the following obsolete files and folders for a clean static project:

- backend/ (entire folder)
- node_modules/ (if present)
- package.json, package-lock.json (if not used by frontend)
- main.js, main-fixed.js (if not used by frontend)
- All .bat and .ps1 scripts in the root (run.bat, run.ps1, setup-and-run.bat, setup-and-run.ps1, start-app.bat, start-browser.bat, start-desktop.bat, start.bat, test-backend.bat)
- frontend/js/app.js
- frontend/js/dashboard.js
- frontend/js/transactions.js

After deleting, your project will be a pure static offline web app.
